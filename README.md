# Project 1 - Mancala

## Technologies used

* jQuery - DOM manipulation, animations
* Google webfonts
* JavaScript - namespaced, heavy on arrays
* HTML/CSS - Relatively basic but with some alpha blending to give the illusion of depth

## Approach taken

For this project I concentrated on producing a working model first before manipulating the DOM based on the model.
I've tried to integrate as many of the techniques we learnt as possible.

## Installation

It's a web game: just open the index.html! Instructions are built into the game.

## Unresolved

I ran out of time before I could add sound effects. I would also like to have further polished the presentation
and made more use of animation, preferably custom. Also I discovered too late that there is standard notation
for the game: it would have been great if it were possible to save the moves taken.

Finally there are a *lot* of variants of the game. I wish I could have modelled some more variants.
